Medication offers a better balance of benefits and costs than nonpharmacological interventions, so the committee agreed to recommend it when ADHD symptoms are persistent and still causing a significant impairment in at least one domain of everyday life despite the implementation and review of environmental modifications. The committee was aware of the implications of medication in this young population and made several recommendations to ensure its responsible use. These include recommendations on: • checking that environmental modifications have been done before starting medication • carrying out a thorough baseline assessment • ensuring that medication is initiated only by healthcare professionals with training and expertise in diagnosing and managing ADHD • early review of medication to optimise its use (including checking for adverse effects) • regular review to ensure that medication is continued only for as long as it is needed • offering ADHD-focused support for all children and young people with ADHD.", "page": 42, "section_path": ["Rationale and impact", "Managing ADHD – children aged 5 years and over and young people", "Why the committee made the recommendations"]}

The committee used the evidence, their experience and the drug licensing to recommend methylphenidate as a treatment for children aged 5 years and over and young people, and lisdexamfetamine or methylphenidate as a treatment for adults. The committee acknowledged the rising cost of dexamfetamine since 2008 and agreed that it should only be considered when lisdexamfetamine is effective but the longer effect profile is not well tolerated. The committee agreed that if methylphenidate has not been effective for children aged over 5 years and young people, then lisdexamfetamine could be considered. Atomoxetine and guanfacine were the non-stimulant drugs with the most convincing evidence. The committee noted that atomoxetine is more widely used and that there was stronger evidence for a benefit of atomoxetine compared with placebo than guanfacine compared with placebo. One trial directly comparing atomoxetine with guanfacine generally showed a clinically important benefit of guanfacine. Taking into account the licensing status of these drugs and the familiarity of most healthcare professionals with them, the committee recommended that in children aged 5 years and over and young people, either drug could be offered after intolerance or a lack of response to stimulants (methylphenidate and lisdexamfetamine).

{"type": "paragraph", "text": "Evidence showed clinically important differences in sleep disturbance, decreased appetite and weight changes in people taking ADHD medication. In the committee's experience, these are some of the most troublesome adverse effects. Because of concerns about decreased appetite and weight change, the committee advised that weight should be checked every 3 months in children aged 10 years and under, and at least every 6 months in older children and young people; BMI should be monitored in adults. The committee recommended that changes in sleep pattern should be recorded and medication adjusted accordingly. There was some evidence that people on atomoxetine may experience sexual dysfunction, in particular erectile dysfunction, and the committee agreed that this should be monitored.", "page": 48, "section_path": ["Rationale and impact", "Medication – monitoring effectiveness and adverse effects", "Why the committee made the recommendations"]}

{"type": "paragraph", "text": "The evidence identified several factors that affect adherence to treatment and these were supported by the committee's own experience. The evidence highlighted time management and forgetfulness as particular issues, so the committee made a recommendation that healthcare professionals should be aware that people with ADHD may have problems remembering to order and collect medication. The committee provided examples of how healthcare professionals might encourage people to follow strategies that support adherence (for example, following clear instructions and using visual reminders). A common worry about treatment is that it might change personality and the committee agreed that this could affect adherence to both medication and non-pharmacological treatments. Misconceptions about the effects of treatment and worries about adverse effects were common themes identified, and the committee agreed that it was important that healthcare professionals address these. Evidence identified that the attitudes of people close to a person with ADHD can influence adherence. The committee agreed that it was important that although children and young people should take responsibility for their own health (including taking medication), parents and carers should oversee them. The committee discussed that adherence to non-pharmacological treatment was an important issue that was rarely addressed. They used their own experience to recommend that healthcare professionals discuss the commitment, time and organisational skills needed for successful adherence to non-pharmacological treatment.", "page": 49, "section_path": ["Rationale and impact", "Adherence to treatment", "Why the committee made the recommendations"]}

{"type": "paragraph", "text": "Evidence identified concerns around lack of follow-up and the opportunity to review medication choices and this was supported by the committee's experience. They agreed that a yearly review with an ADHD specialist should be a comprehensive assessment that revisits the areas discussed when starting treatment but also the effect of current treatment. This would ensure that decisions around continuing or stopping treatment are fully informed. Limited evidence showed possible worsening of ADHD symptoms on stopping medication but supported a reduction in adverse effects after withdrawal. The committee used their experience to make a recommendation on emphasising the importance of assessing the overall benefits and harms of medication as part of a review. The committee agreed that it was important to highlight the elements of a medication review that are important for someone with ADHD; they based the elements on evidence on adverse effects of medication, management of treatment, adherence and information and support.", "page": 50, "section_path": ["Rationale and impact", "Review of medication and discontinuation", "Why the committee made the recommendations"]}
